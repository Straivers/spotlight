# Spotlight

    Spotlight is a knowledge library built to support the Zettlekasten method for
individual use. All units of knowledge (called 'atoms') are held in an
append-only chain, where both new atoms and modifications to existing atoms are
added to the end. These atoms are linked together into a graph, which can be
traversed to explore associated atoms. When an atom is modified, any links that
point to it do not automatically point to the new version. Instead, the user is
prompted to update them when the atom is first visited. These links may also be
promoted manually if desired.
